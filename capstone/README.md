## 📘 Dataset Description  
This project uses the **[Sentiment140 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)** created by *Kazanova (2009)*.  
The dataset contains **1,600,000 labeled tweets**, extracted using the Twitter API, with sentiment polarities for positive and negative tweets.  
The goal is to build a **machine learning model** that predicts the sentiment (positive or negative) of incoming tweets based on their text content.

## 🧩 Attribute Information  
### 📱 Tweet Information  
| Feature | Description |  
|----------|--------------|  
| **target** | Sentiment label: 0 = Negative, 4 = Positive (Note: 2 = Neutral is not present in this dataset) |  
| **ids** | Unique ID for each tweet |  
| **date** | UTC timestamp of the tweet |  
| **flag** | Query flag (if the tweet was collected via search; often "NO_QUERY") |  
| **user** | Twitter username of the poster |  
| **text** | The raw text content of the tweet |

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Social media platforms like Twitter generate vast amounts of text data reflecting public opinions, emotions, and trends.  
The aim of this project is to **predict the sentiment of incoming tweets** (positive or negative) using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.  
This project seeks to:  
- Identify key textual features influencing sentiment  
- Build classification models to predict tweet sentiment  
- Analyze model performance on real-world, noisy text data (e.g., handling abbreviations, emojis, and slang)
